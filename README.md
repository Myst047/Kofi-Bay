# Kofi-Bay
Kofi-Bay is an imaginary coffee shop and this repository contains an analysis of sales done by the shop in one year time period. Analysis is completely made in Mircrosoft Excel and the final product is a responsive Dashboard with which you can interact and use it as per your need. <br>
**This repository includes:**
" Coffee Shop Sales " file, which is the dataset I analyzed and worked on.
" Kofi-Bay Dashboard " file, which is the final Dashboard I created after analyzing the dataset.
" Final Dashboard Preview " file, which is a preview of the final Dashboard I created.
" Analysis Report " file, which contains all the questions and answers and the whole analysis about the data.
